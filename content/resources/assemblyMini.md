# Assembly language mini exercises

This page has some suggested assembly language mini exercises.

Starter project containing `Makefile` and hello world example program: [asmMini.zip](asmMini.zip)

Solutions: [asmMini-soln.zip](asmMini-soln.zip)

## Count to 10

Write an assembly language program that prints the integers from 1 to 10.

Expected output:

```
1
2
3
4
5
6
7
8
9
10
```

## Count to N

Write an assembly language program that prompts the user to enter an integer value, and then prints the integers from 1 to the input value.

Example session (user input in **bold**):

```
Enter an integer: <b>7</b>
1
2
3
4
5
6
7
```

## Count to N by increment

Write an assembly language program which prompts the user to enter two integer values, a maximum and an increment. The program should then print out the integers from 1 to the maximum (inclusive), incrementing by the increment value.

Example session (user input in **bold**):

```
Enter maximum: <b>11</b>
Enter increment: <b>3</b>
1
4
7
10
```
