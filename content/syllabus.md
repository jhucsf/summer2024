<p>The object of the university...is not so much to impart knowledge to the pupils, as whet the appetite, exhibit methods, develop powers, strengthen judgment, and invigorate the intellectual and moral forces. It should prepare for the service of society a class of students who will be wise, thoughtful, progressive guides in whatever department of work or thought they may be engaged.</p>
<p>...our simple aim is to make scholars, strong, bright, useful, and true.</p>

## Course Information

The course is about computer systems from the programmer’s perspective. We will
make a fairly deep dive into topics such as data representation, memory,
assembly language, CPU architecture, networks, and concurrency. By the end of
the course you will know a lot about how modern computers really work and how to
take advantage of their advanced features.

<em>Prerequisites:</em> Intermediate Programming (EN.601.220). Required.

### Compressed Schedule

This course is normally taught in-person during the fall and spring semesters.
These semesters are typically 15 weeks long (or 16 weeks before breaks). This is
already quite an undertaking since other universities typically cover this same
content as 2 or 3 separate classes.

This summer offering has two major differences:

* Lectures will be offered in an online, synchronous format. Attendance at
  lecture with camera and microphone on is expected and will form part of your
  overall grade (see participation).
* Per scheduling requirements from the summer programs office, the course will
  be compressed into 8 weeks.

We will not be reducing the course content or assignments this summer.

This means you will have approximately half the time for each assignment as your
fall or spring peers. If this course is normally a 3 credit class that feels
like a 4 credit class, then this summer’s offering will feel like a 6 to 8
credit class. Please set your expectations accordingly.

We recognize that making this compressed format a success is a team sport. We
are committed to doing our part. For example, we will give grades and feedback
to students in an expedited manner.

## Course Goals

By the end of the course you will

1. Understand machine data types and arithmetic
2. Be able to understand and write assembly language programs
3. Understand machine-level memory organization
4. Understand some types of machine-level security vulnerabilities and how to avoid introducing them
5. Understand memory hierarchies
6. Understand architectural features of modern processors, and how to optimize code for efficient execution
7. Understand how linkers enable the creation of executables from separately-compiled modules
8. Understand dynamic linking and run-time loading of shared objects
9. Understand process address space layout
10. Understand virtual memory translation hardware and how it is used for memory isolation and sharing
11. Understand basic principles of computer networking
12. Use networking APIs such as sockets to implement network applications
13. Use concurrency using abstractions such as threads

This course will address the following Criterion 3 Student Outcomes:

Graduates of the program will have an ability to:

2) Design, implement, and evaluate a computing-based solution to meet
a given set of computing requirements in the context of the programs
discipline.

## Course Topics

* Machine-level data representation
* Computer architecture
* Assembly-language programming
* Performance optimization
* Memory hierarchy and caching
* Virtual memory
* Networks
* Concurrency

## Course Expectations and Grading

Class meetings will consist of lecture and discussion, interspersed with
in-class activities.

Your course grade will be determined as follows:

* Programming assignments: 55%
* Exams: 39% (3 exams, each worth 13%)
* Participation: 6%

You have a total of 72 late hours to use as needed for homework assignments
throughout the course. Late hours cannot be used for exams.

All work must be received by 26 July.

If you are planning on using more than 24 late hours on an assignment, please
send a private message to the instructors on Slack to let us know. Assignment
submissions which exceed the maximum number of late hours will (generally) not
be considered for credit. Having said that, we understand that exceptional
circumstances can arise. If you are in a situation where you think you may need
additional late hours, please notify your instructor as soon as possible.

Participation credit is earned by attending class and participating in peer
instruction quizzes.

## Ethics

The strength of the university depends on academic and personal
integrity. In this course, you must be honest and truthful, abiding by the
[Computer Science Academic Integrity Code](https://www.cs.jhu.edu/academic-programs/academic-integrity-code/):

> Cheating is wrong. Cheating hurts our community by undermining academic
> integrity, creating mistrust, and fostering unfair competition. The
> university will punish cheaters with failure on an assignment,
> failure in a course, permanent transcript notation, suspension, and/or
> expulsion. Offenses may be reported to medical, law or other professional
> or graduate schools when a cheater applies.
> 
> Violations can include cheating on exams, plagiarism, reuse of assignments
> without permission, improper use of the Internet and electronic devices,
> unauthorized collaboration, alteration of graded assignments, forgery
> and falsification, lying, facilitating academic dishonesty, and unfair
> competition. Ignorance of these rules is not an excuse.
> 
> Academic honesty is required in all work you submit to be graded. Except
> where the instructor specifies group work, you must solve all homework and
> programming assignments without the help of others. For example, you must
> not look at anyone else’s solutions (including program code) to your
> homework problems. However, you may discuss assignment specifications
> (not solutions) with others to be sure you understand what is required
> by the assignment.
> 
> If your instructor permits using fragments of source code from outside
> sources, such as your textbook or on-line resources, you must properly
> cite the source. Not citing it constitutes plagiarism. Similarly, your
> group projects must list everyone who participated.
> 
> Falsifying program output or results is prohibited.
> 
> Your instructor is free to override parts of this policy for particular
> assignments. To protect yourself: (1) Ask the instructor if you are not
> sure what is permissible. (2) Seek help from the instructor, TA or CAs,
> as you are always encouraged to do, rather than from other students. (3)
> Cite any questionable sources of help you may have received.
> 
> On every exam, you will sign the following pledge: "I agree to complete
> this exam without unauthorized assistance from any person, materials or
> device. [Signed and dated]". Your course instructors will let you know
> where to find copies of old exams, if they are available.

### Generative Artificial Intelligence

Submitting code, writing, or other products created by any generative AI
technology (e.g. Anthropic’s Claude, OpenAI’s ChatGPT, GitHub’s Copilot,
Google’s Bard) is a violation of academic ethics.

### Inclusivity

Johns Hopkins University is committed to creating a classroom
environment that values the diversity of experiences and perspectives
that all students bring.  Everyone here has the right to be treated
with dignity and respect.  Fostering an inclusive climate is important
because research and experience show that students who interact with
peers who are different from themselves learn new things and experience
tangible educational outcomes.  Please join us in creating a welcoming
and vibrant classroom climate.  Note that you should expect to be
challenged intellectually by the instructor, the TAs, and your peers,
and at times this may feel uncomfortable.  Indeed, it can be helpful to
be pushed sometimes in order to learn and grow.  But at no time in this
learning process should someone be singled out or treated unequally on
the basis of any seen or unseen part of their identity.

If you ever have concerns in this course about harassment, discrimination,
or any unequal treatment, or if you seek accommodations or resources,
please reach out to your instructor or the TAs who will take your
communication seriously and will seek mutually acceptable resolutions
and accommodations.  Reporting will never impact your course grade.
You may also share concerns with the department chair, the Director of
Undergraduate Studies (WSE Department Heads and DUSes), the WSE Assistant
Dean for Diversity and Inclusion (Darlene Saporu,
[dsaporu@jhu.edu](mailto:dsaporu@jhu.edu)), the KSAS Assistant Dean for
Diversity and Inclusion (Araceli Frias,
[afrias3@jhu.edu](mailto:afrias3@jhu.edu)) or the Office of Institutional Equity
([oie@jhu.edu](mailto:oie@jhu.edu)). In handling reports, people will protect
your privacy as much as possible, but faculty and staff are required to
officially report information for some cases (e.g., sexual harassment).

## How to Succeed in this Class
* Find teammates for pair assignments early. The ideal scenario is that everyone
  is in a pair on day one. A good teammate is someone you can work well with,
  not just a friend.
* Start lab assignments as soon as possible.
* Test your code thoroughly. Plan to spend about as much time testing your code
  as writing it.
* Use good programming practices.
* Take advantage of instructor and course assistant office hours.
* Ask questions on Slack.
* Form study groups with peers. JHU’s enterprise Zoom subscription is available
  to students and can be used for virtual study sessions.
* Do the assigned reading before class.
* Focus on your learning and education, not your grade.
